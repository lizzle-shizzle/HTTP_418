		\item \textbf{Full name:} Lodewyk Charles Meyers
		\item \textbf{My interests:}
			\subitem Gaming
			\subitem Computers
			\subitem Music
			\subitem User experience design
			\subitem Website design
			\subitem Anything new related to technology
		\item \textbf{My technical skills:}
			\subitem Web development skills
			\subitem Database design
			\subitem Java
			\subitem C\#
		\item \textbf{Past experience that might help:}
			\subitem I collaborated on a website for a school as part of a project.			
		\item \textbf{Non-technical strenghts:}
			\subitem I have a high amount of patience
			\subitem Hardworking
			\subitem Eager to learn new things
			\subitem Enjoy trying to solve complex problems
		\item \textbf{What makes me want to do this project?} I love web development and will enjoy this project a lot. I still want to learn how to use C\# for a web server and web based development and this project will be the perfect opportunity for me to learn C\# web based development.

		\item \textbf{Full Name:} Elizabeth Fae Bode
		\item \textbf{My Interests:}
		\subitem Puzzle Games (eg. Sudoku)
		\subitem Computers
		\subitem Art
		\subitem Music
		\subitem User experience design
		\subitem Website design
		\subitem Gardening
		\subitem Reading books
		
		\item \textbf{My Technical Skills:}
		\subitem Web development skills
		\subitem Database design
		\subitem Java
		\subitem C\#
		\subitem C++
		\subitem Good at writing
		
		\item \textbf{Past Experience that Might Help:} \newline
		I have experience in both C\# and web-based development, however, I do not have a lot of experience in web-based C\# development. I have a willingness to learn though and thoroughly enjoy web-development so I think on this factor alone, that I would be a good candidate for the development of this application. I also have experience in both accounting and mathematics and I enjoyed them both quite a lot at school and again at university.
		
		\item \textbf{Non-technical Strengths:}
		\subitem Good at decision-making
		\subitem Good at problem-solving
		\subitem Hardworking
		\subitem Organised
		\subitem Responsible
		\subitem Eager to learn new things
		\subitem Perfectionist
		
		\item \textbf{What makes me want to do this project?} \newline
		As I mentioned, I have experience in both accounting and mathematics, both of which I am passion about. This passion is made me interested in this project as I love applications that integrate complex calculations with simple but very useful functionality. I enjoy developing in C\# and I enjoy developing functional applications that provide immense value to companies. All these things together, make me really interested in implementing this project.

	\section{Project excecution}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Development Methodology} \newline \newline
		We plan to follow the Agile development methodology as it involves regular communication with the client to ensure the project results in exactly what they want. It also has a focus on the people system and their interactions with it which we believe is way more important than focusing on the processes and tools of the system. We strive to maintain a continues attention to designing the system well and ensuring that all the technical aspects are coherent with the requirements. All of which makes the Agile development methodology perfect for our vision for your project.
		
		\item \textbf{Progress Communication Plan} \newline \newline
		We plan on meeting up with you as the client on a regular basis, either face-to-face or via Skype, whichever is more convenient for you at the time, in order to keep you updated regarding the status of the project and to clarify requirements. We are also willing to communicate either via WhatsApp or email, whichever you prefer, in order to discuss the project and the progress of it, if face-to-face meetings are unable to take place for whatever reasons.
