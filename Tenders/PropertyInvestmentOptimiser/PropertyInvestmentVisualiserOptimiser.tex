   \item \textbf{Reason for Project Tender:} \newline
   The project proposal peaked my interest in several ways. Firstly	I thought it enticing to create an application that will easily be able to aid people's decision making in the property sector. In many ways it is important to be able to make educated decisions. Secondly I find the challenge alluring. While I don't have any experience in accounting, I am willing to broaden my knowledge and experience a whole new side to programming. Lastly I am eager to delve into the information pool at the CSIR in order to deliver my best for this project and any future projects.

		I have done accounting at school and also on varsity level, which I think might help in this project. My father, Dirk Loosen, has been in IT since before I was born and this is what lead to my interest in computers. I have learnt a lot from him, so I might have learnt something from him that could be of use. I also recently had the priveledge of job shadowing him at FNB Bank City. Here I was able to experience a large team of people working on a new application that was being developed using the Agile developement methodology.

		When I read the project proposal I was intrigued by the idea of the project. I have experience in both accounting and mathematics. I have a passion for applications that integrate complex mathematical calculations into their functionality. I enjoy creating applications that can simplify a user's life by solving problems for him/her.

	\section{Project excecution}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Development Methodology} \newline \newline
		We plan to follow the Agile development methodology as it involves regular communication with the client to ensure the project results in exactly what they want. It also has a focus on the people system and their interactions with it which we believe is way more important than focusing on the processes and tools of the system. We strive to maintain a continues attention to designing the system well and ensuring that all the technical aspects are coherent with the requirements. All of which makes the Agile development methodology perfect for our vision for your project.
		
		\item \textbf{Progress Communication Plan} \newline \newline
		We plan on meeting up with you as the client on a regular basis, either face-to-face or via Skype, whichever is more convenient for you at the time, in order to keep you updated regarding the status of the project and to clarify requirements. We are also willing to communicate either via WhatsApp or email, whichever you prefer, in order to discuss the project and the progress of it, if face-to-face meetings are unable to take place for whatever reasons.

		\item \textbf{Technical Challenges \& Possible Solutions} \newline \newline
		Taking into consideration the languages preferred for the development of the Property Investment Visualiser, there will be no problems regarding using Java or C++. As for C\#, we have members in our group quite competent coding in C\# which will aid those who don't have a full grasp on the language. Regarding the accounting knowledge required, we also have group members with accounting knowledge and experience which will be utilised along with online resources to bolster the understanding of the group members who are not familiar with the accounting concepts. \newline
		As for using Particle Swarm Optimisation, we have our HOD at our disposal which we can consult on the matter. We also would make use of the knowledge and resources at the CSIR to further our understanding needed for this project.

		\item \textbf{Technologies we will use for the project:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item For the front end we will use Bootstrap framework along with JQuery to handle AJAX requests to the server. Bootstrap makes making responsive websites very easy, thus the choice in Bootstrap.
			\item For the backend we will use C\# for the RESTful web server to serve the results of calculations to the client. If needed we can also use C\# for the front end of the system.
