		\subsection{Technologies we will use for the project:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item For the front end we will use Bootstrap framework along with JQuery to handle AJAX requests to the server. Bootstrap makes making responsive websites very easy, thus the choice in Bootstrap.
			\item For the backend we will use C\# for the RESTful web server to serve the results of calculations to the client. If needed we can also use C\# for the front end of the system.
