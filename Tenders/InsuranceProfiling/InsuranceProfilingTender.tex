		\item \textbf{Past Experience that Might Help:} \newline
		I have a decent accounting and mathematical background which should aid in the implementation of this project. I thoroughly enjoy web-development and interface design which is appropriate for this project as it is a necessary component that needs to be developed. I have dabbled in scraping components but I do not have much experience in scrapers nor do I have much experience in developing profiling engines. However, I am eager to learn both of these types of components and have no doubt that once I have an understanding of how to develop them, that I will be able to implement them with my team to the utmost of my ability.
		
		\item \textbf{Non-technical Strengths:}
		\subitem Good at decision-making

		\item \textbf{What makes me want to do this project?} \newline
		I am very interested in working with Retro Rabbit and have been since I spoke to a couple of their employees at the career day in the IT building at the University of Pretoria. I also enjoy, as mentioned above, web-development and have experience in both mathematics and accounting, which made me very interested in this project.

   \item \textbf{Reason for Project Tender:} \newline
   The project proposal peaked my interest in several ways. Firstly I was curious to extend my		      knowledge with regards to the subtropical farming that is present in South Africa and how it plays    its role as a significant forex earner in our country. Secondly I was delighted to see that there      is a need for an application, as I wish to further extend and broaden my knowledge in the field of    Mobile Development. This project I believe I will tackle with enthusiasm and grit. Lastly I was        also intrigued by the thought of helping farmers with an app to help them better their yield. I      want to know more of how this could be further extended to help not only farmers, but other          business owners as well.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Development Methodology} \newline \newline
		We plan to follow the Agile development methodology as it involves regular communication with the client to ensure the project results in exactly what they want. It also has a focus on the people system and their interactions with it which we believe is way more important than focusing on the processes and tools of the system. We strive to maintain a continues attention to designing the system well and ensuring that all the technical aspects are coherent with the requirements. All of which makes the Agile development methodology perfect for our vision for your project.
		
		\item \textbf{Progress Communication Plan} \newline \newline
		We plan on meeting up with you as the client on a regular basis, either face-to-face or via Skype, whichever is more convenient for you at the time, in order to keep you updated regarding the status of the project and to clarify requirements. We are also willing to communicate either via WhatsApp or email, whichever you prefer, in order to discuss the project and the progress of it, if face-to-face meetings are unable to take place for whatever reasons.

		\item \textbf{Technologies we will use for the project:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item For the front end we will use Bootstrap framework along with JQuery to handle AJAX requests to the server. Bootstrap makes making responsive websites very easy, thus the choice in Bootstrap.
			\item For the backend we will use Python along with Django. Django offers REST wrapping for the Ajax requests that will come from the client. Python is chosen because of the relative few lines of code for a task as opposed to Java. Therefore we will need less development time to develop a server with built in AI functionality to do the risk profiling.
