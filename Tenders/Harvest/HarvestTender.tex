		\item \textbf{What makes me want to do this project?} Doing  this project sounds like it can be fun. It sounds like I might learn something new in the Subtropical industry. It will also be interesting to see how the service is being realised to help the farmers determine better yields. Finally it would be nice to learn how to create an app that uses GPS and other technologies needed for this project.
